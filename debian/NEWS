python-keyring (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version no longer supports the conversion of pre-0.9 Crypto-based
  keyring files. The version in wheezy (0.7.1-1+deb7u1) automatically converts
  these files when you use it, so if you were using python-keyring in wheezy,
  you are not affected.

  Otherwise, if you used the Crypto backend, you should convert these files
  manually using /usr/share/python-keyring/convert-crypto-keyring script from
  the python-keyring package.
